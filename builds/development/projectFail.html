          <h2>A high proportion of large IT projects fail.</h2>
          <p>In my experience, far too many software and systems projects end up with major cost blowouts, much less functionality than promised, and in many cases outright failure.</p>
          <p>This is not a new phenomenon, it’s been like this since businesses started developing systems: yet as an industry we haven’t been able to learn from these failures.</p>

            <h3>Project Failures</h3>
            <p>Can you imagine what would happen in the construction industry if the costs for a new building blew out from $6 million to $1.2 billion? The builder would never get another project!</p>
            <p>This happens time and time again in the IT industry and yet often the vendor is barely affected because project blowouts are almost the normal outcome.</p>
            <p>Usually insiders will say the problems were obvious from the very beginning</p>
            <p class="greenBullet">key initial decisions being made by people with very little knowledge of software development,</p>
            <p class="greenBullet">a lack of clarity in defining the scope and expected outcomes,</p>
            <p class="greenBullet">the development being managed by a vendor who makes money by supplying lowly paid developers at high daily rates, and</p>
            <p class="greenBullet">too many people on both the business and IT side with limited experience on similar projects.</p>

            <h3>The Consequences</h3>
            <p>One result of the failures is many businesses rely on very old software for critical business functions; much of which dates back to the 70’s and 80’s.</p>
            <p>Another result is excessive caution in new projects where Insurers look for global Vendors with conservative solutions that have a very well established client base.</p>
            <img src="images/icon_help4.png" alt="">
            <p>It seems to me the industry tries to solve the problems by dodging the real issues. Instead of addressing the real problems, they go for a quick fix that, while it may keep the business satisfied temporarily, end up making the IT environment more complex and the next major project even more difficult.</p>

      <h2>Common ‘Quick Fix’ options taken are:</h2>

          <section class="padding">
            <h3>Quick Fixes</h3>
            <p class="greenBullet">Focus on glossy front end (i.e. smart phone and tablet apps, and websites). The result is a new layer of front end with complex interfaces to the core systems, but the real processing still happens in the old (and inefficient) back end systems.</p>
            <img src="images/icon_help3.png" alt="">
            <p class="greenBullet">Moving to a managed outsource arrangement. The business will be banking on the external vendor being more effective and efficient at running the systems than their own internal team, and passing on the savings. With luck this is possible, but the major problem is that this a one way move. Once the systems are shifted it’s virtually impossible to bring them back, meaning the business will be relying on the good faith of the outsourced vendor to continue good service and maintain low rates.</p>

        <article class="floating-Section">
          <img src="images/icon_help2.png" alt="">
          <p class="greenBullet">Bypassing the IT department by using an external SaaS solution. As the solution will require tailoring to business needs and integration to the existing systems, it will be a major project. And similar to my first point, will rely on the old systems to handle the main processing.</p>
          <p class="greenBullet">Bringing in something new (such as a new project methodology, a new architectural model or a new rapid development programming language). While these may at best solve one or two problems, they are not a panacea. All the past problems are not going disappear by implementing one of these, and avoiding the core problem.</p>
          <p class="greenBullet">Selecting an out-of-date solution from a Global Vendor with a large, well-established client base so they can say they picked a safe option.</p>

          <h2>Ditch quick fix options.</h2>
          <p>Instead invest in a genuine, long-term software solution for your business. This starts with proper planning and management of your project.</p>
          <p>My experience is the above options do not increase the likelihood of success and also will simply result in either another failure or if successful make the IT landscape much more complex and inflexible making future maintenance and projects much more difficult.</p>
          <p>To succeed the best technology available should be used and management should make sure the following are true:</p>
